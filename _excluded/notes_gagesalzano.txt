Adding a new grid style:
I’m wondering if we should add a new media queries for the grid around 700px-ish range where we bump the cols all down to two? Trying to avoid this super-smashed grid at certain sizes…see example attached Grid700px.png.

I noticed a weird centering issue. 
See attached CenteringIssue.png

I think it would be fixed if you removed the right and left margin, I kind of like the grid expanding the width of the screen anyway.

you want glassdoor link at front and not the extra p at end?

cant download third bluebox-mobile image
and the other one downloaded without arrow
cant download last glassdoor image
2015 gif or new img?

make sure you didnt forget to select the src= when changing to '-mobile'
glassdoor first slide for some reason mobile is set to fullwidth
you added a whole new slide just to give three new sizes of the same image
gusto as example of why you may be creating excessive divs ... but no clones so who cares. except some of these sdktop divs hvw ull heigth etc.visaversa still who cares i think

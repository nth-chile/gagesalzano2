- that one paragraph width bug on slides where it wont go 100% width
- .bgs overlap each other
- home link shows github 404



if I scroll down, as usual the address/tab bar scrolls up. And as it does, it fires resize events.

GUSTO
gage could make new first img to full bleed it
then maybe throw on the p from the second slide
third full, throw on p from fourth
gage could make new fifth img to full bleed it
img from 7th bring to fith
full bleed 8th (p), except move second img to new slide and full bleed it
full bleed last

- i think at a few specific widths the grid items get rearranged

GUIDE

You will be writing posts in Markdown files. You can use HTML in Markdown files. Block-level tags must be surrounded by blank newlines, and not indented. Markdown syntax will not work inside of HTML tags. If you upload two images in a row of the same size, they will be stacked in mobile. If not of same size, they will be inline. If you upload more than two images in a row, and they can be divided equally into rows, they will be in rows. Build your own srcsets, and write your own captions. Give featured image a class.
If you want the mobile images/order to be different, make two versions of the slide, with classes "desktop" and "mobile"
row <!-- --> to avoid whitespace

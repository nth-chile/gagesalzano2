****GUIDE****

You will be writing posts in Markdown files. You can use HTML in Markdown files. Block-level tags must be surrounded by blank newlines, and not indented. Markdown syntax will not work inside of HTML tags. If you upload two images in a row of the same size, they will be stacked in mobile. If not of same size, they will be inline. If you upload more than two images in a row, and they can be divided equally into rows, they will be in rows. Build your own srcsets, and write your own captions. Give featured image a class.
If you want the mobile images/order to be different, make two versions of the slide, with classes "desktop" and "mobile"
row <!-- --> to avoid whitespace

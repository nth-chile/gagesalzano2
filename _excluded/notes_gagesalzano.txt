GUIDE

You will be writing posts in Markdown files. You can use HTML in Markdown files. Block-level tags must be surrounded by blank newlines, and not indented. Markdown syntax will not work inside of HTML tags. If you upload two images in a row of the same size, they will be stacked in mobile. If not of same size, they will be inline. If you upload more than two images in a row, and they can be divided equally into rows, they will be in rows. Build your own srcsets, and write your own captions. Give featured image a class. Decide which parts of the post should be "slides" and wrap them in divs.
If you want the mobile images to be different, make two versions of the slide, with classes "desktop" and "mobile"

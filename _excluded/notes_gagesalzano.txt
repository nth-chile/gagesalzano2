- i think at a few specific widths the grid items get rearranged
- scale up the mail (h and w attributes already changed. stroke problem)
- See MiddleSizes.png I wonder if we go full edge-to-edge images in this size? just by adding styling to a certain viewport width.
- there's an extra link on about
- are there any .column issues?

LATER
- some full pics not as crisp as they could be
- glass ceiling third slide = example of not smooth gradient

****GUIDE****

You will be writing posts in Markdown files. You can use HTML in Markdown files. Block-level tags must be surrounded by blank newlines, and not indented. Markdown syntax will not work inside of HTML tags. If you upload two images in a row of the same size, they will be stacked in mobile. If not of same size, they will be inline. If you upload more than two images in a row, and they can be divided equally into rows, they will be in rows. Build your own srcsets, and write your own captions. Give featured image a class.
If you want the mobile images/order to be different, make two versions of the slide, with classes "desktop" and "mobile"
row <!-- --> to avoid whitespace

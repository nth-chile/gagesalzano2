<img src='{{ '/assets/images/man_raising_hand.png' | prepend: site.url }}' alt='Wave emoji' class='emoji'> <span id='me'>Hi, my name is Gage Salzano.</span>

I'm a graphic & web designer, or whatever you want to call it. I help people create or update their branding, visualize their message, design their website or app and illustrate things. My goal is to <span id='clickingaway'>provide the best quality work I can for a fair price</span>.

I have been lucky enough to have <span id='work-experience'>worked at some cool agencies and studios through the years</span>. I've had the opportunity to work with a lot of different types of companies and learned a ton about what it takes to get projects done.

I got obsessed with this stuff <span id='stealth-gaming'>when I was in grade school</span>, but didn't realize there was an occupation called "Graphic Design" <span id='edinboro'>until I went to college</span>.

I could make a living doing this stuff? <br> Not in my wildest dream.

👋Hi, my name is <span id='me'>Gage Salzano.</span>

I help people conceptualize and design things to help them communicate an idea.

**These are things like:**

* Creative Direction
* Art Direction
* Illustration
* Interface Design
* Motion Design
* Copywriting

**To create things like:**

* Naming
* Brand Strategy & Positioning
* Logo & Identity
* Brand Guidelines
* Books
* Posters
* Brochures
* Mobile and Web Applications
* Websites
* Packaging
* Exhibitions
* Wayfinding

I’ve been lucky to have <span id='work-experience'>worked with talented agencies and studios in Pittsburgh and Chicago</span> throughout the past decade, where I had the opportunity to work directly with companies of all shapes and sizes: from startups to household names spanning industries like hospitality, technology, non-profits, universities consumer goods and real estate.

With this design practice I strive to make work that inspires and helps people, and for companies with good people in them.

I use an approach that leans heavily on research, instinct, hard-work, experience, practice experimentation, preserverence and, most importantly, being nice. 🙂

I’ve been <span id='stealth-gaming'>obsessed with this stuff since grade school</span>, but didn’t realize there was an occupation called “Graphic Design” <span id='edinboro'>until I went to college</span>.

I could make a living doing this stuff? <br> Not in my wildest dreams...

Have an idea of how we could work together? <a href="mailto:me@gagesalzano.com" target="_top">Send me an email already</a>

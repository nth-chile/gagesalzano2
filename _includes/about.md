<img src='{{ '/assets/images/waving_hand_sign.svg' | prepend: site.url }}' alt='Waving hand sign' class='emoji'> <span id='me'>Hi, my name is Gage Salzano.</span>

I'm a graphic web designer or whatever you want to call it. I help people create brands for new companies and initiatives, conceptualize marketing campaigns, visualize and illustrate things and design websites. My goal is to <span id='clickingaway'>always provide the best quality stuff I can for a fair price</span>.

I have been lucky enough to have been <span id='work-experience'>employed at some cool agencies and studios through the years</span>. I had the opportunity to work directly with a range of clients and learned a ton of things about what it takes to get projects done.

I got obsessed with this stuff <span id='stealth-gaming'>when I was in grade school</span>, but didn't realize there was an occupation called "Graphic Design" <span>until I went to college</span>.

I could make a living doing this stuff? Not in my wildest dream.

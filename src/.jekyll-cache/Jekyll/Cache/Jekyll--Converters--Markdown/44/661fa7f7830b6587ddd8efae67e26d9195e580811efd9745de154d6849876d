    <p>Peak was the result of a 3-day workshop focused on finding a way to reduce the costs and inefficiencies around hiring the right candidate.</p>

    <p>Working with a small team, we reviewed research, industry statistics, listened to interviews with users, sketched, discussed, ate M&amp;Ms, and collectively mapped out the entire app.</p>

    <p>We took that thinking and designed the branding, visual design style, and built a clickable prototype for a couple key user flows for the team to test.</p>

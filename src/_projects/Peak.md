Peak was the result of a 3-day workshop focused on finding a way to reduce the costs and inefficiencies around hiring the right candidate.

Working with a small team, we reviewed research, industry statistics, listened to interviews with users, sketched, discussed, ate M&Ms, and collectively mapped out the entire app.

We took that thinking and designed the branding, visual design style, and built a clickable prototype for a couple key user flows for the team to test.

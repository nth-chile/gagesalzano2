Homeroom was the result of a 5-day workshop focused on online higher education and a growing perception that it’s not effective.

As a group we identified a missing aspect of traditional education: relationships. We thought about study buddies, student groups, athletic leagues, and all of the other social parts of student life we felt encourage success and sticking it out through the tough times.

From that insight Homeroom was born. We spent the next couple days ironing out the basic structure and functionality of the application, and then we took it from there designing an interactive prototype to test.
